a = ["car","bike","plane"]
b = [1,2,3.1,4.1]

# 1. simply print a 
# 2. show a and b types

# 3. show referring index 0 in a, index 0 in b
# 4. show referring index 2 in a, index 2 in b

# 5. show list can not exceed its length a[3]

# 6. find a's length

# 7. show adding "rocket" in a

# 8. show removing "car" from a

# 9. insert "car" item into a at 0

# 10. list can be added (concatenated) with different type
# show a,b concatenation and store to c

# 11. show adding b as member to a , a.append(b) 

# 12. remove appended b from a , a.remove(b)

# 13. check if an element qualify something,
# create list comprehension that shows item in b > 3
