# 1. create for loop that print number in range(0,10)

# 2. create python comprehension list of number in range(0,10) as x_list 

# 3. iterate through b using for k,v in b.items()
b = {"name":"student_a","score":3.0}

# 4. iterate through list of num, using for n in num:
num = [1,2,3,4,5]

# 5. show break statement for n in num , if n == 4 then break ,
# showing iteration by printing n

# 6. showing else statement for n in num , if n == 6 then break
# else at the end of loop , showing that n==6 is not valid.

# 7. continue statement for 'for' 
# show for n in num if n is even (n%2==0) then skip by continue
# else add to odd_num_list 
odd_num_list = []
